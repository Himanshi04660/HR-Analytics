3) Job Satisfaction Programs: Focus on improving satisfaction for roles with high attrition, such as Laboratory Technicians and Sales Executives.
4) Career Progression Plans: Employees tend to leave after 1 year, so structured career development plans can improve retention.
5) Further Gender Analysis: Investigate why male employees leave more than females and address potential workplace issues.

Conclusion
The HR Analytics Dashboard provides a detailed view of attrition patterns in the organization. The primary reasons for attrition appear to be low salaries, early career changes, and dissatisfaction in certain job roles. Implementing targeted retention strategies can help in reducing attrition rates and improving employee satisfaction.
